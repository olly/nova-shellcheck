# ShellCheck for Nova

A extension for Nova which integrates [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) for static analysis of shell
scripts in the [Nova](https://nova.app) text editor.

can be opened.

- `npm run test`: runs the tests
- `npm run lint`: runs all lints
- `npm run fix"`: fixes any fixable linter errors
- `npm run watch`: watches for changes, and rebuild the extension
